# Why? What? Where?

You may have some questions about this _framework_ and its purpose, I'll try to reply them here.

---

### Why?
I'm creating this _kinda_ framework to ease and unify all the bots I've created for some online communities.
Expect this to have tons of custom stuff and an unstable API (at least for now).


## What?
This framework allows me to create a simple bot in eris without having to handle things like .env file loading, connection, listeners...
To complement this library, you could use [eris-ts-template](https://github.com/Techie-Pi/eris-ts-template) for an _already-done_ ts + node environment ready for eris

## Where?
Here and at npm ``@techiepi/discord-bot-eris-framework``
